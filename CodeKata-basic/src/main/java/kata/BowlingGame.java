/**
It has now been more than ten years since Kent Beck and Martin Fowler started to talk about Continuous Integration. 
At that time, it was hard to believe this practice would have such an impact on our daily work and would be so much 
adopted in the world of software development. Today, we at SonarSource but also in many places, can simply not
 imagine to go back and work without Continuous Integration.

Here is what can be read about Continuous Integration on Wikipedia :
Continuous integration aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by
 replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control after completing all development.

The ultimate goal of Continuous is to be able to fire any type of release at any time with minimal risk whether
 it is a Milestone, Release Candidate or GA : quality requirements become a must-have and no more a nice-to-have. 
 Letâ€™s review which requirements are correctly covered by continuous integration environments today :

Anybody must be able to build the project from any place and at anytime.
Every Unit Tests must be executed during the Continuous Integration build.
Every Unit Tests must pass during the Continuous Integration build.
The output of the Continuous Integration build is a package ready to ship.
When one of the above requirement is violated nothing is more important for the team than fixing it.
